* Quantity – amount of a position, either in lots or in units, depending on what is selected in the Settings dialog box;
* Date/Time – date and time when a position was opened;
* Gross P/L – profit/loss in account currency, calculated on base of price difference:

        For Long position: Gross P/L = Qty. \* Lot size \* (Current price - Open price)

        For Short position: Gross P/L = Qty. \* Lot size \* (Open price - Current price)

        P/L for Spreadbet instrument type is calculated depending on price change in ticks:

        For Long position: Gross P/L = Qty. \* Bet size \* Cross price \* ((Current price - Open price)/Tick size))

        For Short position: Gross P/L = Qty. \* Bet size \* Cross price \* ((Open price - Current price)/Tick size))

        Cross price is applied in the case when account currency doesn't correspond to the Betting currency.

* P/L, offset – profit/losses in points;
* Position exposure – exposure of a position, in the account currency. Calculated on base of an open price:

        Position exposure = Price \* Quantity \* Lot size \* Cross price (quoting CCY > account currency) – calculation for Forex

        Position exposure = Price \* Quantity \* (Tick cost/Tick size) \* Cross price (quoting CCY > account currency) – calculation for Futures

        In all cases Cross price (quoting CCY > account currency) is a current cross price.

* Position value – current value of a position. Calculated on base of a current market price:

        For Long position: Position value = Position exposure + P/L

        For Short position: Position value = Position exposure – P/L
