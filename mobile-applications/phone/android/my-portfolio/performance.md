* Pie chart - shows the amount of funds that were invested into the Portfolio considering “Portfolio balance” as well as “Holding period rate of return” from the moment of investment.
* Doughnut chart - shows the “Portfolio allocation” values. The number of chart sectors corresponds to the number of assets in the portfolio as well as Cash.
