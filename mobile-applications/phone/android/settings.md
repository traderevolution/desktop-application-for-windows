The **"**Other" settings section cannot be displayed in the application settings if the biometric authentication is not checked in the system settings of the device or it is blocked. 

Biometric authentication enables a user to log in to the mobile application more securely by using the Fingerprint or FaceID features.

To apply Fingerprint in the application for subsequent logins, a user should put his finger on the sensor.

The user authentication occurs after putting a finger on the sensor and successful fingerprint recognition.

In case the FaceID feature is available and activated on the user device, it can be used as an additional application login option instead of the Fingerprint:

### Push notifications

TraderEvolution app provides the ability to receive push notifications on numerous events such as the daily loss limit warning, margin warning, receiving a new trading idea, etc. Upon receiving a push notification, the user can tap on it and thus open the application. Sending push notifications to the device is regulated by your broker, i.e. you cannot activate this function by yourself. If the user wants to disable receiving push notifications, he can do it in the settings of his device.
