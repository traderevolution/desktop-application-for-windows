**Order type:**

Order type defines the type of the order – Market, Limit, Stop, Stop limit, Trailing stop:

1. Market order guarantees execution at a market price.
2. Limit order is placed with a brokerage to buy or sell a set number of shares at a specified price or better.
3. Stop order is placed to buy or sell a security when its price surpasses a particular point, thus ensuring a greater probability of achieving a predetermined entry or exit price, limiting the investor's loss or locking in his or her profit. The![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/oe-android-kopiya.png)icon informs a user that additional Limit price is available if the checkbox 'Use stop limit instead of stop' is active in the Settings; 
4. Stop limit order will be executed at a specified price (or better) after a given stop price has been reached. Once the stop price is reached, the stop-limit order becomes a limit order to buy (or sell) at the limit price or better.
5. "Sell" trailing stop order sets the stop price at a fixed amount below the market price on the trailing offset. As the market price rises, the stop price rises by the trail amount, but if the stock price falls, the stop loss price doesn't change, and a market order is submitted when the stop price is hit. "Buy" trailing stop orders are the mirror image of sell trailing stop orders.

**Validity:**

Validity – allows specifying order validity by selecting among the following time frames: Day, GTC, IOC, GTD, FOK, GTS. This is especially important for active traders:

1. Day order, as the name implies, is valid for the current trading day.
2. GTC (Good till cancelled) orders, on the other hand, will remain alive until they are cancelled.
3. IOC (Immediate or Cancel Order) requires that all or part of the order be executed immediately after it has been brought to the market.
4. FOK (Fill or kill) – requires to execute the entire transaction immediately and completely or not to execute it at all.
5. GTD (Good till date) allows input date until which the order will be cancelled if not executed.

* SL/TP price – allows to set Stop loss and Take profit prices.

When the checkbox near SL price is true, and the checkbox 'Use stop limit instead of stop' is also true (a setting located in Defaults tab of General settings), the additional field 'SL limit price' will appear. It shows Limit price which is set for SL order. The field can be also displayed as 'SL limit offset'. This field shows Limit offset for SL order. The dependence is related to the values in which SL is displayed -  in price or offset.

* Trailing SL offset – allows entering the order trailing stop price.

SL price and Trailing SL offset cannot be checked together.
