The main quote section consists of the following columns:

* Price – buy or sell price from the highest Bid and the lowest Ask to lower Bid and higher Ask.
* Size – the volume being offered to purchase at a specified Bid price or to sell at specified Ask price.

The best Bid and best Ask prices are located at the top of the histogram. Volumes are located opposite to the corresponding prices.
