### **Reordering columns**

User can rearrange columns in tables by moving them to new locations. Click on a column header and drag the column to the desired location in the table.

### Sorting

 Table data can be sorted by any column. Clicking on a column header sorts the data in descending order. To sort in ascending order, click on the header once again. When data is sorted, special icon appears in the header showing the sorting direction.
