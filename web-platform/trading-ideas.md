# Trading ideas

A Trading idea or simply an Idea is an investment recommendation based on the market analysis. It includes predefined parameters for order placement as well as text description and chart snapshot.

The panel allows to send Ideas and subscribe to them, depending on the user’s role – user-analyst or user-subscriber.

### **User-analyst**

User-analyst is a user who can create, delete and send Ideas to user-subscribers but is not allowed to trade by himself. For the user-analysts the Ideas analyst panel is available in the terminal from the ‘Tools’ list in the Top menu. Ideas analyst panel contains 2 tabs:

**New** – ​tab that allows setting all parameters for sending a new Idea:

In order to send an Idea, a user-analyst has to specify mandatory order parameters:

* Symbol – allows selecting the instrument that will be used in the Idea;
* Side – allows selecting Idea operation side: buy or sell;
* Validity – dropdown list for selecting the order validity type \(Day, GTC, IOC, FOK, GTD, GTS\);
* Product type – dropdown list for selecting the type of the product for the Idea. This parameter becomes available, when the product type for the symbol used differs from the General. Available options: Intraday, Delivery.

With that, if the product type available to the User subscriber differs from the one specified in the Idea by the User analyst, the User subscriber can switch from "_Delivery"_ to "_Intraday"_ product type:

If there is only one product type available to the User subscriber and it differs from the one specified in the Idea by the User analyst, in the Idea view for the subscriber, only the available product type is displayed with no option to change it by the User subscriber;

* Limit price – field for entering the limit price for the order;
* SL price – Stop Loss price of the order;
* SL offset – field that shows the SL offset value;
* SL limit price – Limit price for SL order;
* SL limit offset – Limit offset for SL order;
* TP price – Take Profit price of the order;
* TP offset – field that shows the TP offset value;
* Current price – field that shows the current symbol price \(if available\);
* Expiration date – allows specifying the period of the idea lifetime, during which a user-subscriber can accept the idea. The expiration date is set in the corresponding calendar control:
