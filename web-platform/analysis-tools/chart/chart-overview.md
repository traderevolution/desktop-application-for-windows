### **Navigation**

Users can zoom in and out on charts, scroll it horizontally and vertically, change the bar width, and manually refresh the chart.

#### **Time zooming**

To zoom in and out on the Chart panel users can use the scroll button on their mouse or simply drag the chart border in the Timeline panel using the scroll:

The scroll bar functions are similar to the scroll bar in a web browser - click, hold, and drag. Use scroll to move the data on the chart, "+" and "-" buttons to zoom in or out, and the arrow-icon to go to the last quote bar. Also, the chart can be zoomed in using the "Shift + mouse wheel" hotkey combination. Please note that in this case, not the usual zooming combination with a "Ctrl" button is used, since this button is already used for visual trading. When using this hotkey combination, zooming occurs to the mouse cursor point, that is, the chart remains centered. This feature works when the mouse cursor is over the chart.

#### **Price scale zooming**

User can zoom in or out on the chart by price scale \(vertically\). Click on the price axis, drag it up and down to scale the price axis.

#### **Scrolling the chart**

To scroll the chart horizontally, just drag the active section in the Timeline, or click inside the chart and drag it there.

For vertical scrolling the automatic scaling feature must be turned off. To do this, click the Manual zoom button on the chart or the appropriate function in the settings. This will enable vertical scrolling by clicking inside the chart and dragging it up and down.

If a user prefers Auto scale mode, he may choose fit indicators, fit orders/positions, or fit day High/Low options to be sure that all desired values are visible on the Chart that automatically scales.

#### **Refreshing the chart**

The Chart refreshes automatically. If, however, a user needs to refresh the Chart manually, right-click inside of the Chart and select Refresh. This action will reload the chart data and redraw chart.

#### **Additional options**

Right-clicking on the timeline shows the panel with additional options:

* Show time periods separators - this option displays the vertical lines on the Chart to separate different days, weeks, months and years.
* Show holes in the history - this option displays bars with no price that appears when the market is closed.
