# Workspaces

A workspace is a particular configuration of panels, toolbars, charts and/or table layouts that makes up trading environment. The application for Desktop provides a predefined default workspace and allows to create custom workspaces either by modifying the default settings or by creating a new workspace from scratch. Custom workspaces can be saved as .wrk files and reopened whenever required.

The application for Desktop will automatically load the default workspace upon startup.

After making changes to a workspace, it becomes a custom workspace.

All your workspaces are located in the Desktop terminal installation directory C:\Users\user\Documents\TraderEvolution x64\My workspaces  
  
To have quick access to this folder click on the button ‘More’ at the top of the terminal and choose ‘Open data folder’:

Custom workspaces will automatically save changes when closing the application for Desktop. While working with the terminal every 10 minutes all opened workspace are saved automatically without confirmations.

### Keeping multiple workspaces open 

During session, several workspaces can be loaded and kept open simultaneously. All opened workspaces are shown in the bottom of panel. User can switch between the open workspaces by toggling the tabs.
