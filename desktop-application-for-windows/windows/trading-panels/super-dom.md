When clicking on the P/L value, the following options can be selected: Ticks/Fractional ticks for Forex/Points.

Furthermore, Ticks/Fractional ticks for Forex/Points can be selected in 'Show offset in' in the section 'Trading defaults' of the 'General settings'.

Break-even = (Long qty.\*Average long – Short qty.\*Average short)/(Long qty. – Short qty.)

1. Net QTY = Qty1 + Qty2 + Qty3
2. Gross QTY = |Qty1| + |Qty2| + |Qty3|

The color of QTY cell depends on the side of the position:

1. If all positions have Side = Long, qty. cell will be colored in blue;
2. If all positions have Side = Short, qty. cell will be colored in red;
3. If positions are multi-directional, then qty. cell is not colored;
4. If there are no positions, qty. cell will not be colored and qty. value = N/A.

* When trading multi-position symbols, open price of all the positions is calculated as weighted average value;
* The Orders column shows all pending orders and allows their modification. Limit orders are displayed as numbers, and Stop orders - as underlined numbers. Group of orders is displayed with two vertical lines of the pending order left side;
* The Size column shows how many trade operations with Ask/Bid are available at a specific price;
