# Volatility lab

Volatility lab tab is used for graphic analysis before starting to trade options:

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/1 (49).png>)

This tab allows plotting the "Volatility lab" which is considered as a totality of IV values for a specific option contract. Also, it is possible to plot "Volatility lab" graph according to actual market data and Vanna-Volga implied volatilities model.

See the blue chart for "Volatility lab" plotted according to actual market data and the red one for Vanna-Volga implied volatilities model on the chart below:

### **Vanna-Volga implied volatilies model calculation algorithm**

This model is plotted for selected option series and gets the following elemental parameters:

* Days to expire of selected option series – Days/365;
* Underlier price – can be Forward or Current last price, is calculated with taking into account interest rates.

If Forward price is selected in the settings, then Forward price is calculated this way:

Forward price = Current last price \* e^(M\*Days/365), where

M = Domestick rate/100 - Foreign rate/100;

* ATM strike – is a strike, value of which is the closest to a Current last price value;
* ATM IV – an arithmetic mean of ATM Call and Put strikes IV;
* D Call strike – is a Call strike, Delta absolute value of which is the closest to a Delta value in the settings![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/screenshot\_1 (18).png>); 
* D Call IV - D Call strike IV;
* D Put strike - is a Put strike, Delta absolute value of which is the closest to a Delta value in the settings;
* D Put IV - D Put strike IV;
*   Strikes array of selected option series.

    These parameters are used in array’s model values IV calculation for selected option series.

    The calculated series are reflected on the Volatility lab chart.

### &#xD;**Chart settings menu**

In the Chart settings menu you can choose the Side, Visible series and Volatility models to be displayed on the chart:

In order to hide the Chart settings menu, press the button![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/screenshot\_3 (5).png>), this will result into the chart’s maximization.

* The drop-down list in the Side section allows selecting an option side (strikes) on which the "Volatility lab" will be plotted. Available strikes are Calls, Puts, Calls\&Puts:

* The section Visible series allows selecting series for "Volatility lab". Mark series as checked to get one or more "Volatility lab" graphs plotted on the chart:

* Pressing![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/th (1).png>)  allows to define graph’s thickness (from 1 to 10 px), and pressing![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/1y.png)calls the dialog window for graph’s color selection:

Marking the option![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/vv.png)as checked in the Volatility models section allows to plot Vanna-Volga implied volatilities model.

 This graph can also get its individual parameters via thickness and color selection (![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/th.png),![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/d.png)). 

* The drop-down list of the Option series section allows selecting an appropriate series for Vanna-Volga implied volatilities model:![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/screenshot\_4.png).

Be attentive to choose the same series for Vanna-Volga implied volatilities model as for “Volatility lab” graph plotted according to actual market data.

### Chart scaling

 The chart view can be manipulated with the buttons![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/screenshot\_5 (4).png>), located in the buttom-right corner of the chart field: 

* Pressing the button![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/screenshot\_12.png)allows to zoom out of any random area of the chart;
*  Pressing the button![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/screenshot\_7.png)allows to zoom in to any random area of the chart;
*  Pressing the button![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/+.png)  allows to enable selecting any area of the chart for zooming in. Pressing this button again disables this option.

The chart view can be also manipulated with some additional options:

* Hovering the cursor over a chart’s dot + mouse wheel scrolling - allows zooming in to and zooming out of a chosen dot![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/dd.png)of any chart;
*  Clicking + holding + moving the cursor on a random area of the coordinate plane![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/screenshot\_14.png)- allows to focus the chart view on this area of the coordinate plane;
* Clicking + moving the cursor on any area on the X or Y axis - allows to move on the left/right (X) or up/down (Y) on this area on the X or Y axis;
* Clicking + scrolling on any area on the X or Y axis - allows to zoom in to and zoom out of this area:
