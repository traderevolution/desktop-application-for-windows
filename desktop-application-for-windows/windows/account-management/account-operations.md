Select account name and Withdrawal or Remaining amount. The confirmation message about blocking withdrawal amount will appear.

If a broker \[administrator\] withdraws money from a user account, the user receives a message about this. It's always best to confirm account withdrawals with a broker before proceeding.

Withdrawal operations required broker approval. When a request is made, the broker can confirm or reject the transfer. While the request is pending, funds will be set aside as "Blocked balance."
