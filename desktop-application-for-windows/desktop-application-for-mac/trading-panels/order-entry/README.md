Order entry panel allows a user to place market or pending orders. To open the panel, select Terminal -&gt; Order entry. Additionally, this panel can be seen within Chart:

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28109%29.png)

This panel contains the following settings:

* Account – the account used for an order creation;
* Symbol – the symbol available for the trade;
* Side – allows to activate Buy or Sell side;
* Quantity – an amount of lots in which an order is placed;
* Order type – defines the type of the order: Market, Limit, Stop, Stop limit, Trailing stop, OCO:

1. Market order is an order to buy or sell a security at the best available price immediately;
2. Limit order is placed to buy or sell a security at specified price or better;
3. Stop order is placed to buy or sell a security when its price surpasses a particular point, thus ensuring a greater probability of achieving a predetermined entry or exit price, limiting the investor's loss or locking in his or her profit. The![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/mac-oe-kopiya.png)icon informs a user that additional Limit price is available if the checkbox 'Use stop limit instead of stop' is active in the Preferences;  
4. Stop limit order will be executed at a specified price \(or better\) after given stop price has been reached. Once the stop price is reached, the stop-limit order becomes a limit order to buy \(or sell\) at the limit price or better;
5. OCO \(One-Cancels-the-Other\) is an order stipulating that if one part of the order is executed, then the other part is automatically canceled;
6. "Sell" trailing stop order sets the stop price at a fixed amount below the market price on the trailing offset. As the market price rises, the stop price rises by the trail amount, but if the stock price falls, the stop loss price doesn't change, and a market order is submitted when the stop price is hit. "Buy" trailing stop orders are the mirror image of sell trailing stop orders;

* Validity – allows specifying order validity by selecting among the following time frames: Day, GTC, IOC, GTD, FOK. This is especially important for active traders:

1. A Day order, as the name implies, is valid for the current trading day;
2. GTC \(Good till cancelled\) orders, on the other hand, will remain alive until they are cancelled or the contract expires;
3. IOC \(Immediate or cancel \) requires the whole or part of the order to be executed immediately after it has been brought to the market;
4. FOK \(Fill or kill\) requires to execute the entire transaction immediately and completely or not to execute it at all;
5. GTD \(Good till date\) order will be cancelled on specified date if not executed or until the contract expires;

* Stop price \(for the "Stop order" type\) - allows entering the order stop price;
* Limit price \(available together with Stop price for the "Stop order" and "OCO" order types; also available for the "Limit order" type\) - allows entering the order limit price;
* Tr. stop offset \(for the "Trailing stop" type\) - allows entering the order trailing stop price.
* SL/TP price - allows to set Stop loss and Take profit prices.

It shows Limit price which is set for SL order. The field can be also displayed as 'SL limit offset'. This field shows Limit offset for SL order. The dependence is related to the values in which SL is displayed -  in price or offset.

It is always possible to manage risks by setting trailing stop on the order with the left clicking a special button![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/grey.png)located near Stop loss. The blue color of the button![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/blue.png)indicates that the trailing stop is activated.

* Get snapshot - this button is intended to get a snapshot of the actual quotes for the current Symbol. After clicking the button, the snapshot window will be opened. The window header displays the time when the snapshot was made, and in the window itself the user can find the following data:

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/macos.png)

1. Price - displays prices for Symbol in the context of Last/Bid/Ask;
2. Size - volumes for Symbol at the specified Price in the context of Last/Bid/Ask;
3. Change - price change, calculated by the formula _Change = Last price - Previous close_;
4. Change, % - price change as a percentage, calculated by the formula _Change,% = \(Last price - Previous close\) / Previous close\) \* 100%_;
5. Today high - highest price of the day for the current Symbol;
6. Today low - lowest price of the day for the current Symbol;
7. Today volume - current day volume for Symbol.

The "Get snapshot" button allows to update the information in this window.
