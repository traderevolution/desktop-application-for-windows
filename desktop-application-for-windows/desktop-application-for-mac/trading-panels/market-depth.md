Position bar has extended functionality for Multiple position mode:

When clicking the Price value, you can select of two options: Average open price or Break-even.

Break-even = (Long qty.\*Average long – Short qty.\*Average short) / (Long qty. – Short qty.)

When clicking the QTY value, you can select of two options: Net QTY or Gross QTY:

Net QTY = Qty1 + Qty2 + Qty3

Gross QTY = |Qty1| + |Qty2| + |Qty3|

The color of QTY cell depends on a position's side:

a) If all positions have Side = Long, qty. cell will be colored in blue;

b) If all positions have Side = Short, qty. cell will be colored in red;

c) If positions are multidirectional, then qty. cell is not colored;

d) If there are no positions, qty. cell will not be colored and qty. value will have an empty value ( '---' ).

* 'Order entry' is a compact bar similar to the 'Order entry' panel. It can be displayed in two ways: compact view (showing only buttons and main boxes) and extended view (with explanation labels for buttons and boxes). An order entry mode can be adjusted in the 'Market depth Preferences -> View'. An 'Order entry' bar allows you to adjust the following: quantity, type and Validity of an order, limit and stop price;
* Detailed quote section - this section includes the latest quotes data similar to Watchlist panel. But unlike Level I quotes, it shows a total volume at each price level. On the left side are bid volumes and on the right one – ask volumes.

The detailed quote section is the main part of the Market depth panel, and all other bars can be hidden. To choose panel's elements to be visible, open 'context menu -> View':

In the detailed quote section, offers with equal prices are grouped by the same color. There are five available color groups. Quotes with best prices are placed on the top and regrouped each time when a new quote comes.

The detailed quote section is displayed as a table with the columns which can be made visible via the context menu of the table's header:

* Time – time of offer;
* Price – a buy or sell price from the highest Bid and the lowest Ask to lower Bids and higher Asks;
* Size – a volume being offered to purchase at a specified Bid price or to sell at a specified Ask price;
* Source – ECN or exchange, where orders are set. This field is similar to MPID, but it has another representation on the server. Is unavailable when 'Aggregate size' is active in the 'Market depth Preferences';
* MPID (market participant ID) – ECN or exchange, where orders are set;
* Total size – the aggregated traded volume;
* VWAP – prices of order executions including slippage effect that will take place depending on order quantity;
* Counter CCY value – a value of Ask/Bid size recalculated in the quoting currency, Price \* Ask/Bid size;
* Counter CCY Total value – a value of total Ask/Bid size recalculated in the quoting currency, Price \* Total Ask/Bid size;
* Reset to factory defaults – allows to reset this section's view to the default view.
