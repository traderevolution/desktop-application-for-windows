### Columns

Under the 'Positions' toolbar there is a table. The context menu of this table's header allows to adjust visibility of its columns. To open this context menu, right-click on the table's header.

Positions panel displays information about all currently opened positions via the following columns:

* Account – a name of a user's account, who opened a position;
* Login – a login of a user, who opened a position;

* Date/Time – time and date of a position's opening in the following format: m/d/y, h/m/s;
* Current price – a market price obtained from a broker;
* Open price – a price which a position was opened with;
* Fee – a total commission amount taken for a position;
* Gross P/L – profit/loss in account's currency, calculated on base of a price difference:

For Long position: Gross P/L = Qty. \* Lot size \* \(Current price - Open price\);

For Short position: Gross P/L = Qty. \* Lot size \* \(Open price - Current price\);

P/L for Spreadbet instrument type is calculated depending on price change in ticks:

For Long position: Gross P/L = Qty. \* Bet size \* Cross price \* \( \(Current price - Open price\)/Tick size\) \);

For Short position: Gross P/L = Qty. \* Bet size \* Cross price \* \( \(Open price - Current price\)/Tick size\) \).

Cross price is applied in case when account currency doesn't correspond to Betting currency.

* Net P/L - profit/loss for a position excluding fee:

Net P/L = Gross P/L - Fee.

* P/L, offset – profit/loss in points;
* Quantity – amount of a position in lots;
* Side – a position's side depending upon a trade's side, can be Long or Short;
* Expiration date – a date of a contract's expiration;
* Strike price – a price of an option contract's performance;
* Position exposure – an exposure for a position measured in account's currency. Calculated on base of open price:

Position exposure = Price \* Quantity \* Lot size \* Cross price \(quoting CCY &gt; account currency\) – for Forex;

Position exposure = Price \* Quantity \* \(Tick cost/Tick size\) \* Cross price \(quoting CCY &gt; account currency\) – for Futures;

In all cases Cross price \(quoting CCY &gt; account currency\) is a current cross price.

* Position value – a current value of a position. Calculated on base of a current market price:

For Long position: Position value = Position exposure + P/L;

For Short position: Position value = Position exposure – P/L.

* SL price – a Stop loss price set for a position;
* TP price – a Take profit price set for a position;
* SL, value – a Stop loss sum in account's currency which trader risks by each symbol in case 'Stop loss' triggers. Also, SL sum by all positions is displayed in Totals on the bottom of the panel, in order you could know how much it is possible to lose;
* SL limit price – Limit price set for SL order;
* Swaps – amounts collected/paid out by a broker when a position is rolled over to a new value date.
* Close – allows to close a position.
