Broker can create news routes, such as: News provider or exact news-wire from the same provider. This feature gives users more possibilities of customization and in some ways decreases the traffic flow through selection of the exact subject or news provider, and not all the news flow in general.

* Received – date and time when news were received.
* Source – source of news.
* Subject – topic of news.
* Content – the whole text of news.
* Category – type of news.
* Symbol – exact instrument on which news have influence.
* Priority – urgency of news.
* Link – direct link to news source.

Note: if any columns are not supported by News provider that fields will be free.
