# Aggregation types overview

To choose the type of aggregation for a chart, click on the Time frame button located near the Style button on the Charts toolbar. The following options are available:

* Time – 1 Minute, 5 Minutes, 15 Minutes, Hourly, Daily, Monthly, Yearly and Custom.
* Tick – sets the number of ticks for each bar \(33, 55, 99, 133...\).
* Price range – focuses on the price only, the bars in this chart close when a range completes.
* P&F \(Points and Figures\) – only price changes are recorded. If no price change occurs then the chart is left untouched.
* Renko – price charts with rising and falling diagonal lines of boxes that are either filled or hollow.
* Kagi – a series of vertical lines connected by short horizontal lines. The thickness and direction of the lines is based on the price of the underlying stock or asset.
* Line break - displays a series of vertical boxes that are based on the closing prices.
* Heikin Ashi – chart with this aggregation is very similar to the simple Time chart built in the style of Japanese candles. The only difference is a modified calculation algorithm of the main candle price parameters – Open, High, Low and Close.
* Cluster – displays value of the specific parameter \(Volume, Delta, Trades, etc.\) by each price level. One cluster corresponds to one bar.
* Profile – displays each bar in the form of “market profile”. The base for building the profile is typical time bars or tick bars which instead of general candle are displayed as a column of letters of the Latin alphabet.
