The scroll bar functions are similar to the scroll bar in a web browser - click, hold, and drag. Use scroll to move the data on the chart, buttons "+" and "-" to zoom in or out, and the arrow-icon to go to the last quote bar.

The chart has a possibility of moving "bar by bar" using a hotkey. A hotkey can be set in general settings -&gt; Hotkeys -&gt; Chart; by default hotkey F12 is specified. After pressing the hotkey, the chart will be moved on one bar to the left. Moving is performed prior to the default offset to the scale.

#### **Price scale zooming**

User can zoom in or out of the chart by price scale \(vertically\). Click on the price axis, drag it up and down to scale the price axis.

#### **Scrolling the chart**

To scroll the chart horizontally, just drag the active section in the Timeline, or click inside the chart and drag it there.

For vertical scrolling the automatic scaling feature must be turned off. To do this, click the Manual zoom button on the chart or the appropriate function in the settings. This will enable vertical scrolling by clicking inside the chart and dragging it up and down.

Three types of the price scale are available: Absolute, Relative and Logarithmic.

* Absolute - displays the price scale in the absolute units.
* Relative - displays the price scale in the relative units, where as a starting point can be used: first point of the screen visibility, point of the day opening, and starting point of the history.
* Logarithmic - logarithmic scale representation, where as a starting point can be used the same points as for relative scale.

If a user prefers Auto scale mode, he may choose fit indicators, fit orders/positions, or fit day High/Low options to be sure that all desired values are visible on a Chart that automatically scales.

#### **Refreshing the chart**

Charts refresh automatically. If, however, a user needs to refresh the chart manually, right click inside of the Chart and select Refresh. This action will reload the chart data and redraw chart.

#### **Right information button**

Working with right mouse button, user can get the following information:

* Bars – the number of bars between two selected points.

* ∆Price – price difference between two selected points at each end of the line.
* Ticks – price difference shown in ticks between two selected points.
* Profit – shows how much a trader could earn if the price has gone up/down from point 1 to point 2.

In order to get this information, click right mouse button, hold it and lead the mouse across the screen to the needed point.
